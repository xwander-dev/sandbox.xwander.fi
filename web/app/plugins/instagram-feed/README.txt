== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display multiple Instagram feeds on my site or on the same page? =

Yep. You can display multiple Instagram feeds by using our built-in feed creation tool, for example: `[instagram-feed feed=2]`.

= Can I display photos from more than one Instagram account in one single feed? =

Yep. You can connect multiple accounts and include them as sources when creating a feed.

= Does the plugin work with Instagram oEmbeds? =

Yes. In version 2.5, support was added to allow the plugin to power your Instagram oEmbeds as official support for these is no longer available in WordPress core. Just connect your account on the oEmbeds settings page inside the plugin and we'll do the rest. No developer app or account required.

= Can I display a feed with in a widget or with a block? =

Yes. Use the Instagram widget or Instagram block to display your feed in a sidebar or other widget area.

= How do I connect my Instagram account? =

We've made it super easy. Just follow the steps outlined when onboarding and you will have a connected account with simple clicks.

= My feed isn't displaying. Why not!? =

There are a few common reasons for this:

* **Your Access Token may not be valid.** Try clicking on the blue Instagram login button on the plugin's Settings page again and copy and paste the Instagram token it gives you into the plugin's Access Token field.
* **The plugin's JavaScript file isn't included in your page.** This is most likely because your WordPress theme is missing the WordPress [wp_footer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer) function which is required for plugins to be able to add their JavaScript files to your page. You can fix this by opening your theme's **footer.php** file and adding the following directly before the closing </body> tag between two php tags: `wp_footer();`
* **Your website may contain a JavaScript error which is preventing JavaScript from running.** The plugin uses JavaScript to load the Instagram photos into your page and so needs JavaScript to be running in order to work. You would need to remove any existing JavaScript errors on your website for the plugin to be able to load in your feed.

If you're still having an issue displaying your feed then please open a ticket in the [Support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/instagram-feed 'Instagram Feed Support Forum') with a link to the page where you're trying to display the Instagram feed and, if possible, a link to your Instagram account.

= Are there any security issues with using an Access Token on my site? =

Nope. The Access Token used in the plugin is a "read only" token, which means that it could never be used maliciously to manipulate your account.

= Can I view the full-size photos or play Instagram videos directly on my website?  =

This is a feature of the [Pro version](https://smashballoon.com/instagram-feed/?utm_campaign=instagram-free-readme&utm_source=faqs&utm_medium=fullsize 'Instagram Feed Pro') of the plugin, which allows you to view the photos in a pop-up lightbox, support videos, display captions, display photos by hashtag + more!

= How do I embed my feed directly into a WordPress page template? =

You can embed your feed directly into a template file by using the WordPress [do_shortcode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) function: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[instagram-feed]'); ?>`.

= My Feed Stopped Working – All I see is a Loading Symbol =

If your Instagram photos aren't loading and all your see is a loading symbol then there are a few common reasons:

1) There's an issue with the Instagram Access Token that you are using

You can obtain a new access token on the Instagram Feed Settings page by using the "connect" button to reconnect the account.

Occasionally the connect button inside the plugin does not successfully update the access token. You can try [this link](https://smashballoon.com/instagram-feed/token/?utm_campaign=instagram-free-readme&utm_source=faqs&utm_medium=faqconnectionissue) as well.

2) The plugin's JavaScript file isn't being included in your page

This is most likely because your WordPress theme is missing the WordPress wp_footer function which is required for plugins to be able to add their JavaScript files to your page. You can fix this by opening your theme's footer.php file and adding the following directly before the closing </body> tag:

<?php wp_footer(); ?>

3) There's a JavaScript error on your site which is preventing the plugin's JavaScript file from running

You can find out whether this is the case by right clicking on your page, selecting 'Inspect Element', and then clicking on the 'Console' tab, or by selecting the 'JavaScript Console' option from your browser's Developer Tools.

If a JavaScript error is occurring on your site then you'll see it listed in red along with the JavaScript file which is causing it.

4) The feed you are trying to display has no Instagram posts

If you are trying to display an Instagram feed that has no posts made to it, a loading symbol may be all that shows for the Instagram feed or nothing at all. Once you add an Instagram post the Instagram feed should display normally

5) The shortcode you are using is incorrect

You may have an error in the Instagram Feed shortcode you are using or are missing a necessary argument.

= What are the available options that I can use to customize my feed? =

There are plenty of options to customize your feed! See the list below:
* **General Options**
* **width of feed** - The width of your feed.
* **height of feed** - The height of your feed.
* **background color** - The background color of the feed. Any hex color code.
